They can be divided into two categories. Total events track the action taken by a visitor on a file on your website every time the action is performed. Unique events track user-based action made once and not repeated (i.e. log-in for the first time on the website). If your website’s events are not analyzed, knowledge about how your visitors interacts with your content won’t be available, and some important information might be missed.","lang":"en","createdAt":"2020-06-01T00:00:00","sourceTestsetId":"waaila-united-ga","guid":"94d823e5-dc8e-4369-a310-e8a7128c39d7","sourceVersion":1,"furtherInfo":"","adminLibraryTestsetId":"dec1ceb4-b04a-4cb1-8ab4-c4448c0c614b","adminLibraryGuid":"b5ca9ea0-6ee5-4b7c-860a-61acd5b5354a","constants":[],"blocks":[{"nr":"1","type":"@warn","description":"Test measures the amount of all events to track the interaction the users have made on your website and verify that this amount is positive.
