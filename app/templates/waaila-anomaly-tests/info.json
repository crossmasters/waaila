Patterns are evaluated across the available values. The tests expect weekly patterns in the data, however, if the data do not have weekly cycles, the tests can still be performed but you can only expect weaker findings. There is no additional configuration of the tests necessary, nor is there any additional resource necessary as the tests run within Waaila only.", "references": 55, "rating": 4.9, "ratings": 27, "reviews": 18, "recentlyUpdated": true, "featured": true, "mostPopular": false}
