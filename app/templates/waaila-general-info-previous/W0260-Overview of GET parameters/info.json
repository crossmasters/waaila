Without them, it is not possible to see if your parameters are correctly set to track your website, or to see how users are moving on the website. Allowing dynamics URLs, the overview of those parameters is allowing you to know the parameters used in your URLs for you to exclude according to your objectives. That will help to reduce granularity of pages in GA reports.",
