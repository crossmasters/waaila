Ingesting more than 10 million hits a month per property has impact on how your data are processed and stored.  Also, measurement will be slow and larger sampling errors will appear than before. In worst case it might even happen that Google is going to delete your property. This however happens rarely and only if you ingest a lot more hits than this limit. More likely you will receive emails from Google Sales to think about a paid solution of Google Analytics 360.
