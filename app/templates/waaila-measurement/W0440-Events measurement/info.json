They can be divided into two categories. Total events track the action taken by a visitor on a file on your website every time the action is performed. Unique events track user-based action made once and not repeated (i.e. log-in for the first time on the website). If your websiteâ€™s events are not analyzed, knowledge about how your visitors interacts with your content wonâ€™t be available, and some important information might be missed.","lang":"en","sourceTestsetId":"waaila-measurement","guid":"9d102f18-9837-40c8-a866-c8a468231d1f","ðŸ‡¸ourceLibraryId":"waaila","sourceVersion":3,"createdAt":"2020-06-01T00:00:00","furtherInfo":"","adminLibraryTestsetId":"5c369a41-158f-431e-9c6f-30df95841067","adminLibraryGuid":"33ede145-941e-4d8b-a058-39e137a1a021","constants":[],"blocks":[{"nr":"1","type":"@warn","description":"Test measures the amount of all events to track the interaction the users have made on your website and verify that this amount is positive.
