This test depends on your insertion of acceptible values of hostnames in the data. For the first part of the test you need to input list of hostnames that need to appear always in your data (the parameter necessaryDomainsArray). For the second part of the test you need to add hostnames which are permitted to appear in your data. You do this by constructing the permittedDomainsArray parameter which needs to contain all the values from the necessaryDomainsArray and in addition the values of hostnames that are additionally allowed to appear.
You can run the test first with the default parameters. When running with the default parameters, you can disregard the first part which will inform you that 'main-domain.com' and 'other-domain.com' are missing in your data. The second part will provide you with an overview of all hostnames currently measured in your data. Use this overview by copying the values into both parameters to configure test for your case.
